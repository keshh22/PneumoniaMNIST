Machine Learning Classification of the MNIST Pneumonia Dataset

This project delves into two distinct challenges. Firstly, the primary objective is to assess the efficacy of 
developing a robust training algorithm for the Pneumonia MNIST dataset using a limited dataset comprising only 
10 randomly selected class-balanced samples. The overarching inquiry revolves around  the  extent to which en-
hanced accuracy can be achieved under these constraints. Significantly, the investigation places emphasis on the 
exclusion of external data and any pre-trained models in the algorithmic development process. Empirical evidence 
is presented, showcasing the superior performance of the ResNet18 architecture coupled with the RandAugment 
augmentation technique, resulting in a notable 5% improvement over the baseline Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) and its associated hyperparameters. 

Secondly, the  study extends its focus to the  same aforementioned challenge but with the added flexibility of 
incorporating external data or models not specifically trained on the target dataset. This broader scope allows for 
a  more  comprehensive  exploration  of  the  algorithmic  capabilities  and  their  potential  enhancements.  Through  a 
meticulous  analysis,  the  report  aims  to  elucidate  the  impact  of  leveraging  external  resources  on  the  algorithm's 
performance, thereby contributing valuable insights to the domain of medical image classification.
